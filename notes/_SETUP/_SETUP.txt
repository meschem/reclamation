obj_run_controller tracks the currentFloor and currentRoom,
and simply references obj_dungeon to get that information. obj_dungeon
shouldn't DO anything active once setup, it's mainly for storing info.
	
To start this Process:

create_dungeon(biome) creates an actual dungeon.
	* This creates an instance of a dungeon
	* This creates all the floors AND the rooms for those floors
	* Floors are simply a collection of rooms, but dungeonRoom structs are more complex
	* These structs effectively decide how things will be spawned
	
obj_run_controller does most of the heavy lifting, including using its
loadRoom(dungeonRoom) method to load a room. Once the room is loaded,
the obj_run_controller will setup the the spawners for the current room,
based off of information in the obj_dungeon.
